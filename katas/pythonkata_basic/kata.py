### Define Vars
"""
1. Define a integer
2. Define a second integer
3. Print both integers
4. Type cast a integer variable from 1 or 2 into a float and print it.
"""

rock = 12
stone = 7
print(rock, stone)
print(float(rock))

### Use the following built in fuctions
"""
1. type()
2. print()
3. range()
4. int()
5. str()
6. float()
7. len()
"""
print(type("cats")) # print type string
print(list(range(1,100,2))) # Print every other number from 1-100
int_as_string = str(15)
int_as_float = float(15)
float_as_int = int(3.14159)
print(len([1,4,19]))

### List Challenges
"""
1. Define a list with 1 string, 1 int and 1 float
2. Print the 3rd element of your list
3. Define a emply list
4. Reverse the order of the list from 1., do it 2 different ways
5. Create a list of numbers from 0-9
```
numlist = list(range(10))
```
6. 0utput only the first 3 elements of numlist
7. output only the last 3 elements of numlist

5. Print the value for key 'fuel' of the dict from 1.
6. Loop through all element of the dict from 2. and print the keys and values
7. Use help to find a built in fuction for dicts that prints all the keys. hint help(shuttle)
"""
